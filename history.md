# Web Front End History

## Tuesday 1/9/24
Beginning to do some actual work. I've not gotten through all the Udemy training yet but, want to get started.

1. Got this history.md file created
2. Mucked around with the styles.css sheet.
3. Am reviewing Section 6 of the Udemy bootcamp
4. Updated the Readme with the actual Azure static website URL

## Tuesday 2/6/24
Stopping the Udemy class. Got through the API section. The rest of course appears to be Node JS and React. I will take what I've gone through and reference it as needed as I start building some type of web site. Not sure what yet. I envision a site that retrieves data from an API and displays it on the page in a table or graph. I can use the APIs I built using Azure Functions (in DHL account) or, another 3rd party source. I think I will:

1. Build a site connecting to 3rd party API to understand how to connect, bring data in, display it, pass search parameters etc.
2. I will use Google Charts to learn that software
3. Then, when I'm comfortable to move on, I can build the backend using SQL Server, Azure Function API (or another one of the rapid API building technologies from Microsoft) in my personal Azure account.
4. Then I can find a use case for building a front end to the tables to populate data. Use case perhaps in DHL.

**PROJECT**
Let's try working with this Countries rest API:
https://restcountries.com/

Looks simple. I loaded this endpoint in Postman and without having to do anything else, I got json of all the countries.
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all

Done for today. Will now try to commit and sync with my github repo that, is connected to my static azure web page. Let's see if it works.
