# Web Front End History

## Tuesday 1/9/24
Beginning to do some actual work. I've not gotten through all the Udemy training yet but, want to get started.

1. Got this history.md file created
2. Mucked around with the styles.css sheet.
3. Am reviewing Section 6 of the Udemy bootcamp
4. Updated the Readme with the actual Azure static website URL
