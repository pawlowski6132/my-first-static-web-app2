# Vanilla JavaScript App

[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build JavaScript apps in minutes. Use this repo with the [quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/getting-started?tabs=vanilla-javascript) to build and customize a new static site.

This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.

This repo has a dev container. This means if you open it inside a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or using [VS Code with the remote containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), it will be opened inside a container with all the dependencies already installed.

What's been done. I went through the above and setup an Azure Static Web app in my personal Azure account.

I setup the environment in VSCode and have the Github directory.

The way it works, is it's all connected. I do the work in VSCode, commit and sync to repo in Github. That automatically get's pushed/synced to the Azure static web app found here:
